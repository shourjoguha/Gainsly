This workout consists of short and quick rounds. This means it's easy to come out at a fast pace and burn out too soon. Move at a consistent pace that allows for 1-2 minutes per round in the first half of the workout. Choose dumbbells that allow you to consistently perform 4 quality reps at a time. Scale double-unders to timed attempts or single-unders if needed to finish in less than 30 seconds. If you have done this workout before, tackle the toes-to-bars however you need to in order to improve your score. For all others, shoot to perform the 6 reps done in 1-2 smooth sets every round.",

    "description": "Stimulus and Strategy:\n\nToday, you'll tackle the classic CrossFit benchmark workout Grace, which should be a sprint! To get the most out of this workout, use a load that allows you to move well and cycle for 2-3 sets of 5 or more reps with very little rest between. The magic of this workout doesn't come from the volume of reps or the load, but how you push yourself to keep moving, hang on to the bar longer than you want, and immediately pick it back up when you don't want to. If you're scaling and can open with 20 unbroken reps, the load is likely too light. If you've done this workout before and have a score to beat that's within the 2- to 7-minute stimulus, go for it. If you have done this workout before and scaled, but think you can go heavier today, give it a shot. Even if you end up on the slower end of the intended time domain, that's OK for today.",

    "description": "Stimulus and Strategy:\n\nToday\u2019s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. This effort elegantly combines technique of a complex lift and efficiency of cycling repetitions. The loading of the barbell should be moderate. If you can perform the prescribed loading safely and keep your overall time under 15 minutes, go for it. Otherwise, adjust the weight, dial in the technique, and get after it. If you have completed this workout in the past, look back at your loading and time to help you navigate today\u2019s effort.\nScaling:\n\nReduce the loading of the barbell.\nTo reduce the complexity of the snatch, perform hang snatches.\nIn case of injury or limitation, perform alternating dumbbell snatches. If there is an overhead limitation, perform cleans.",

Push the pace of the run, but only as much as you can get back to your barbell and right to work on your back-rack carry. For the back-rack carry, take the barbell out of a rack, if possible. Otherwise, if necessary, reduce the load and take the barbell from the ground. The loading for the back-rack carry should be moderate and uncomfortable after the first 100-200 meters. Push through the doubt and challenge yourself to walk the entire distance without putting the barbell down. If you do have to put it down, remember, you\u2019ll have to pick it back up and get it on your back. Shut out the negative thoughts and have fun with this challenge.\nScaling:\n\nReduce the distance of each movement. Reduce the loading of the barbell.\nTo reduce the complexity of the back-rack barbell carry, reduce the distance. For the walking lunge, perform a reverse lunge or reduce the range of motion.\nIn case of injury or limitation, for the 800-meter run, perform 1,750/2,500 meters on the Echo bike or 800/1,000 meters on the rower.
