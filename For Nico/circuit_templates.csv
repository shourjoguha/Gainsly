Happy New Year's Eve! Today’s workout is a Hero. If you have completed this workout in the past, look at your previous score to help navigate today’s attempt. Before the start of this workout, take a brief moment to remember why you are doing it — everybody has their own reasons. As always with a Hero workout, this is going to be a grind. Choose movement variations and loadings that allow you to keep moving.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell and plate. Reduce the distance of each run. Reduce the reps of each movement.


To reduce the complexity of the squat cleans, perform a hang squat clean. For the box jumps, reduce the height of the box. For the overhead walking lunges, perform walking lunges with a single dumbbell in the goblet position.


In case of injury or limitation, for the run, perform 3,200/4,000 meters on the rower or ski erg or 7,000/10,000 meters on the Echo bike. For the squat cleans, perform power cleans, plus a front squat, or power cleans if there is a squatting limitation. For the box jumps, perform box step-ups. For the overhead walking lunges, perform walking lunges with no weight.

:

Today’s workout is all bodyweight movements. Scale the difficulty of each element so you can keep moving and perform the reps of each movement unbroken — more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.


Scaling:

The exercises with the most reps are push-ups through jumping lunges — anywhere from 36 to 42 reps. Reduce the reps as needed or only perform the even rounds (i.e., in Round 1, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 2, complete 4 knee push-ups, 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding two new exercises each even round).


To reduce the complexity of these bodyweight movements, reduce the range of motion. For example, on the wall walks, only take two steps toward the wall or perform inchworms. On the burpees, perform up-downs. On the handstand push-ups, perform dumbbell shoulder presses or pike push-ups. And for the single-leg squats, use a higher target, air squats, or even a narrow-stance air squat.


In case of injury or limitation, substitute equipment to preserve the movement function as much as possible, or choose an alternative suitable for your situation.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

12 rounds for time, starting with 1 and adding an exercise each round:

1 
inchworm

2 candlestick rocks

3 burpees

4 push-ups 
from the knees

5 walking lunges

6 air squats

7 sit-ups

8 jumping squats

9 jumping lunges

10 broad jumps

11 
dumbbell shoulder presses

12 
box step-ups


♀ 
10-lb dumbbell, 12-inch box

♂ 
15-lb dumbbell, 20-inch box


Perform the workout like the ""12 Days of Christmas"" song. In Round 1, perform 1 inchworm. In Round 2, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 3, perform 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding a new exercise each round.


Coaching cues:

As you lower yourself to the bottom of an air squat, think about grabbing the floor with your toes and “screwing” your feet into the ground. This will keep your knees tracking your toes and your entire foot in contact with the ground.

:

Today’s effort is three individual mile runs. Compare each mile to your split times of the most recent 5K run two weeks ago. The goal is to push the pace on each mile faster than those splits. The rest between sets should allow you to recover enough to push each effort.


Scaling:

To reduce the volume of this effort, cut the distances in half.


Today is a day when most athletes can perform this as prescribed. However, if you are new or less experienced, complete the beginner option.


In case of injury or limitation, perform 3,500/5,000 meters on the Echo bike or 1,600/2,000 meters on the rower.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

3 rounds, each for time:


800
-meter run


Rest 5 minutes between efforts.


Coaching cues:

Check your running posture — relax your shoulders, keep your torso upright, and set your gaze directly ahead of you. Maintaining a neutral spine and sound running posture will allow for more efficient running technique, reduced fatigue, and improved recovery.

Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell and plate. Reduce the distance of each run. Reduce the reps of each movement.


To reduce the complexity of the squat cleans, perform a hang squat clean. For the box jumps, reduce the height of the box. For the overhead walking lunges, perform walking lunges with a single dumbbell in the goblet position.


In case of injury or limitation, for the run, perform 3,200/4,000 meters on the rower or ski erg or 7,000/10,000 meters on the Echo bike.

:

Today’s workout combines a movement with an extensive range of motion with two static holds. Expect this effort to be more metabolic than you think it might be. The thruster weight should be relatively light and allow you to perform your reps unbroken. For the holds, choose variations that allow you to complete both in 3 sets or fewer. Perform the handstand hold against a wall.


Scaling:

Reduce the load of the barbell. Reduce the duration of the holds.
To reduce the complexity of the thrusters, perform the movement with a pair of dumbbells.


For the L-sit holds, bend the knees of one or both legs. For the handstand holds, perform pike holds or plank holds.


In case of injury or limitation, for the thrusters, perform single-arm dumbbell thrusters. If there is an overhead limitation, perform front squats. If there is a squatting limitation, perform push presses. For the L-sit holds, perform seated leg-raise holds. For the handstand holds, perform seated dumbbell shoulder press holds with one or two dumbbells.

Today is a heavy day. Keep in mind that heavy is relative to each athlete's capacity and experience. Look at your previous attempt to help navigate today’s workout. As long as you are working to your limits, you will benefit from this effort. Experienced athletes should plan to go as heavy as possible across all sets as long as technique and safety are maintained. Newer athletes should start light, focus on mechanics, and slowly add weight as they are comfortable.


Scaling:

To adjust the complexity of the lift, consider performing the movement with a pair of dumbbells or completing shoulder presses.


In case of an injury or limitation, consider using a single dumbbell or kettlebell. If you are unable to add load, consider handstand push-ups, pike push-ups, or push-ups.

:

This workout will challenge endurance and lower-body stamina with a variety of unilateral movements. Expect the movement redundancy to lead to a substantial amount of lower-body muscular fatigue. On the rower, plan to move at a steady pace to complete each set in under 2 minutes. The single-leg squats will likely be the most demanding part of this workout. Expect the step-ups to be time-consuming. The goal is working at a consistent pace and trying to complete each set of 90  reps in under 4:30.

Today, you'll tackle the classic CrossFit benchmark workout Grace, which should be a sprint! To get the most out of this workout, use a load that allows you to move well and cycle for 2-3 sets of 5 or more reps with very little rest between. The magic of this workout doesn't come from the volume of reps or the load, but how you push yourself to keep moving, hang on to the bar longer than you want, and immediately pick it back up when you don't want to. If you're scaling and can open with 20 unbroken reps, the load is likely too light. If you've done this workout before and have a score to beat that's within the 2- to 7-minute stimulus, go for it. If you have done this workout before and scaled, but think you can go heavier today, give it a shot. Even if you end up on the slower end of the intended time domain, that's OK for today.

Today's workout is a heavy day. Keep in mind that heavy is relative to each athlete. Compare your heaviest lift today to your last lift, and keep track of your result so you can compare it to future retests. Aim to complete 6 to 10 heavy lifts within the 20-minute timeframe. This will allow for the right amount of rest between lifts. Increase loading across each lift, if possible. If you miss a lift, reduce the load and make the needed corrections before building back up.

Same as Rx'd.

In today’s workout, your kettlebell is going to be your best friend. The loading should be moderate and allow you to complete your swings and squats in 2 sets or less. For the Turkish get-ups, perform all reps on one arm before moving on to the other. Rest as needed between reps. Remember that one full Turkish get-up is standing up with the kettlebell overhead and then returning to the starting position.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the kettlebell. Reduce the reps of each movement.


To reduce the complexity of the goblet squats, decrease the range of motion by squatting to a target.


In case of injury or limitation, for the Russian kettlebell swings, perform kettlebell deadlifts or single-arm Russian kettlebell swings. For the goblet squats, perform goblet lunges or air squats. For the Turkish get-ups, perform kettlebell windmills.

Today’s workout consists of pulling and pressing intervals. The goal is to finish each row in 1 minute or less and have around 30 seconds to perform the strict pressing movement. The one-to-one work-to-rest ratio should allow for just enough rest and an opportunity to push the pace on each row.


Scaling:

Reduce the distance on the row.


To reduce the complexity of the strict handstand push-ups, decrease the range of motion by placing one or two AbMats or mats underneath your head. For the strict ring dips, perform foot-assisted ring dips.


In case of injury or limitation, for the row, perform a 200-meter run or 500/700-meter Echo bike. For the strict handstand push-ups, perform pike push-ups or seated dumbbell shoulder presses. For the strict ring dips, perform bench or box dips or banded tricep press-downs.

In today’s workout, expect grip and midline fatigue to be a factor. Manage your reps on the rope climbs and be confident in your ability to complete the rep before attempting a climb. Use a load for the dumbbells that allows you to complete the distance in 2 sets or less. At the end of the day, choose options that allow you to complete the workout in 18 minutes or less. Use caution on the GHD — if you are not consistently using the GHD to perform sit-ups, consider the scaling options below.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the dumbbells. Reduce the reps of each movement.


To reduce the complexity of the GHD sit-ups, decrease the range of motion. For the rope climbs, reduce the height of the climb.


In case of an injury or limitation, for the GHD sit-ups, perform V-ups or AbMat sit-ups. For the rope climbs, perform pull-to-stands. For the dumbbell farmers carries, use one dumbbell or consider unloaded step-ups on a low box.

Today’s workout is a combination of strength, stamina, and cardiorespiratory endurance. Keep in mind that this workout is not only for time, but also for total reps of double-unders and burpees. The loading of the barbell should be heavy, but allow you to complete the set of 21 in 4 sets or less, while maintaining proper form. If you are struggling to maintain a neutral spine, reduce the loading. Expect your heart rate to be significantly elevated after the double-unders and burpees. Take a few breaths to get yourself set before picking up the heavy barbell.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell.


To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, perform single-unders. For the burpees, perform up-downs.


In case of injury or limitation, perform sumo deadlifts with the barbell or a kettlebell. For the double-unders, perform lateral hops over a line or penguin taps. For the burpees, perform calories on any machine available.

Today’s workout is a combination of strength, stamina, and cardiorespiratory endurance. Keep in mind that this workout is not only for time, but also for total reps of double-unders and burpees. The loading of the barbell should be heavy, but allow you to complete the set of 21 in 4 sets or less, while maintaining proper form. If you are struggling to maintain a neutral spine, reduce the loading. Expect your heart rate to be significantly elevated after the double-unders and burpees. Take a few breaths to get yourself set before picking up the heavy barbell.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell.


To reduce the complexity of the double-unders, perform single-unders. For the burpees, perform up-downs.


In case of injury or limitation, perform sumo deadlifts with the barbell or a kettlebell. For the double-unders, perform lateral hops over a line or penguin taps. For the burpees, perform calories on any machine available.


Intermediate option:

For time and total reps:

21 deadlifts

2 minutes of double-unders

Today's workout is a triplet. Manage your pace on the rower to maintain consistent sets on the wall-ball shots and pull-ups. Aim to complete the wall-ball shots in two sets or fewer. For the pull-ups, don’t push to failure too soon. If necessary, consider smaller sets and quicker breaks.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the medicine ball. Reduce the reps of each exercise.


To reduce the complexity of wall-ball shots, lower the height of the target. For the chin-over-bar pull-ups, perform jumping pull-ups.


In case of injury or limitation, perform the calories on any machine available. For the wall-ball shots, perform dumbbell thrusters. In case of a limitation, perform medicine-ball front squats or medicine-ball push presses to a target. For the chin-over-bar pull-ups, perform ring rows.

:

Today’s workout is all bodyweight movements. Scale the difficulty of each element so you can keep moving and perform the reps of each movement unbroken — more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.


Scaling:

The exercises with the most reps are push-ups through jumping lunges — anywhere from 36 to 42 reps. Reduce the reps as needed or only perform the even rounds (i.e., in Round 1, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 2, complete 4 knee push-ups, 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding two new exercises each even round).


To reduce the complexity of these bodyweight movements, reduce the range of motion. For example, on the wall walks, only take two steps toward the wall or perform inchworms. On the burpees, perform up-downs. On the handstand push-ups, perform dumbbell shoulder presses or pike push-ups. And for the single-leg squats, use a higher target, air squats, or even a narrow-stance air squat.


In case of injury or limitation, substitute equipment to preserve the movement function as much as possible, or choose an alternative suitable for your situation.


Intermediate option:

Same as Rx’d.


Beginner option:

12 rounds for time, starting with 1 and adding an exercise each round:

1 
inchworm

2 candlestick rocks

3 burpees

4 push-ups 
from the knees

5 walking lunges

6 air squats

7 sit-ups

8 jumping squats

9 jumping lunges

10 broad jumps

11 
dumbbell shoulder presses

12 
box step-ups


♀ 
10-lb dumbbell, 12-inch box

♂ 
15-lb dumbbell, 20-inch box


Perform the workout like the ""12 Days of Christmas"" song. In Round 1, perform 1 inchworm. In Round 2, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 3, perform 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding a new exercise each round.


Coaching cues:

As you lower yourself to the bottom of an air squat, think about grabbing the floor with your toes and “screwing” your feet into the ground. This will keep your knees tracking your toes and your entire foot in contact with the ground.

Today’s workout is a classic CrossFit benchmark. This effort elegantly combines technique of a complex lift and efficiency of cycling repetitions. The loading of the barbell should be moderate. If you can perform the prescribed loading safely and keep your overall time under 15 minutes, go for it. Otherwise, adjust the weight, dial in the technique, and get after it. If you have completed this workout in the past, look back at your loading and time to help you navigate today’s effort.


Scaling:

Reduce the loading of the barbell.


To reduce the complexity of the snatch, perform hang snatches.


In case of injury or limitation, perform alternating dumbbell snatches. If there is an overhead limitation, perform cleans.

Today’s workout combines a movement with an extensive range of motion with two static holds. Expect this effort to be more metabolic than you think it might be. The thruster weight should be relatively light and allow you to perform your reps unbroken. For the holds, choose variations that allow you to complete both in 3 sets or fewer. Perform the handstand hold against a wall.


Scaling:

Reduce the load of the barbell. Reduce the duration of the holds.
To reduce the complexity of the thrusters, perform the movement with a pair of dumbbells.


For the L-sit holds, bend the knees of one or both legs. For the handstand holds, perform pike holds or plank holds.


In case of injury or limitation, for the thrusters, perform single-arm dumbbell thrusters. If there is an overhead limitation, perform front squats. If there is a squatting limitation, perform push presses. For the L-sit holds, perform seated leg-raise holds. For the handstand holds, perform seated dumbbell shoulder press holds with one or two dumbbells.


Intermediate option:

5 rounds for time of:

10 thrusters

20-second L-sit hold, 
both knees bent

30-second handstand hold

♀ 
35-lb barbell and a 10-lb plate

♂ 
45-lb barbell and a 15-lb plate


Coaching cues:

To increase the thrusters' cycle rate, pull the barbell down from the overhead position. As soon as the barbell touches the shoulders, begin your next rep.

Today’s workout is a couplet and gives Fran vibes. Expect your legs to get gassed by the bike, and at some point, your arms will reach stamina failure/fatigue. Manage your pace on the bike to allow yourself a chance to breathe and get oxygen into your system. Manage your reps on the pull-ups — don’t push yourself to failure too soon. Instead, consider smaller sets, like 5/5 or 4/3/3, with quick breaks.


Scaling:

Reduce the repetitions of each movement.


To reduce the complexity of the chest-to-bar pull-ups, decrease the range of motion.


In case of injury or limitation, for the chest-to-bar pull-ups, perform jumping pull-ups or ring rows. For the Echo bike, choose any available machine.


Intermediate option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:


8 pull-ups


8
-calorie Echo bike


Beginner option:

Complete as many rounds and reps as possible in 10 minutes of:


6 jumping
 pull-ups


6
-calorie Echo bike


Rest 30 seconds after each set.


Coaching cues:

On the chest-to-bar pull-ups, consider placing your hands slightly wider on the pull-up bar than normal. This will reduce the range of motion and make it easier to get your chest to the bar.
