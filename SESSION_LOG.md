# ShowMeGains Development Session Log

Session tracking for continuous development with date/time headers. A new session is defined as any work separated by 45+ minutes of inactivity.

---

## Session 1: 2025-12-29 15:58:49 - 16:09:26 UTC

**Objective**: Complete REST API router implementation and understand architectural decisions

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Created three API routers**:
   - `app/api/routes/days.py` - Daily planning with SSE streaming
     - GET `/{target_date}/plan` - Retrieve daily session
     - POST `/{target_date}/adapt` - Session adaptation with LLM
     - POST `/{target_date}/adapt/stream` - SSE streaming response
     - POST `/accept-plan` - Accept adapted plan
   - `app/api/routes/logs.py` - Workout logging endpoints
     - Workout logging with e1RM calculation and PR detection
     - Soreness and recovery signal logging
     - Pattern exposure tracking
   - `app/api/routes/settings.py` - User settings and configuration
     - User settings (persona, units, e1RM formula)
     - Movement rules CRUD (exclude, substitute, prefer)
     - Enjoyable activities CRUD
     - Heuristics read-only endpoints
     - Movements repository queries

2. **Fixed critical issues**:
   - Resolved Python type shadowing: renamed `date` field to `log_date`, `plan_date`, `session_date` across all schemas
   - Added `greenlet>=3.0.0` dependency for SQLAlchemy async support
   - Fixed pytest version conflict in requirements.txt

3. **Wired all routers** to `app/main.py`

4. **Understood architectural decisions**:
   - Heuristics read-only in MVP for operational safety (versioned configs drive core algorithm logic)
   - Movement rules support exclude/substitute patterns for user preferences
   - SSE streaming implemented for real-time adaptation feedback
   - Conversation threads stored permanently for audit trail

5. **Verified functionality**:
   - App imports successfully
   - Database tables created on startup
   - All endpoints structured with proper error handling

**Technical Notes**:
- Used async SQLAlchemy with aiosqlite for SQLite backend
- All endpoints check user authorization against hardcoded default_user_id
- Schemas use field aliases to avoid Python reserved word conflicts
- e1RM calculations support 4 formulas: Epley, Brzycki, Lombardi, O'Conner

**Remaining Work** (from original TODO list):
- Build core business logic services (ProgramService, AdaptationService, DeloadService)
- Add configuration management system (heuristic config versioning)
- Implement WebSocket chat endpoint (changed to SSE, now done)
- Set up testing infrastructure

## Session 5: 2025-12-29 17:30:00 - 18:00:00 UTC

**Objective**: Complete final two remaining tasks - AdaptationService router integration and performance testing

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **AdaptationService Integration** (Commit d34a186):
   - **days.py /adapt endpoint**:
     - AdaptationService._assess_recovery() called to calculate recovery_score (0-100)
     - Movement rules fetched via _get_movement_rules() for user constraints
     - User preferences loaded via _get_user_preferences() for weighting
     - Constraints enriched with recovery_score, movement_rules, user preferences
     - Recovery score included in AdaptationResponse reasoning
     - Changes_made list enhanced with volume adjustment notes based on recovery
   - **days.py /adapt/stream endpoint**:
     - Same AdaptationService integration applied for consistency
     - Recovery score sent early as SSE metadata to client
     - Constraints with recovery assessment passed to streaming LLM
   - **Workflow**: Recovery signals → Assessment → Constraints applied → LLM adaptation

2. **Performance Testing Framework** (Commit d34a186):
   - Created tests/performance_test_locust.py (204 lines):
     - ShowMeGainsUser class with realistic task distribution (plan 20%, adapt 15%, log 15%, deload 10%, program 5%, idle 35%)
     - StressTestUser class with aggressive load profile (shorter think time, higher adaptation weight)
     - Proper test data generation (program creation, recovery signals with variance)
     - Catch response handling for graceful failure tracking
   - Created PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md comprehensive guide:
     - Setup instructions (Locust installation, app/Ollama setup)
     - Load test scenarios (light, medium, stress)
     - Spike testing instructions
     - Endurance testing for memory leaks
     - Success criteria (p95 < 500ms plan, < 2000ms adapt, 0% error at 50 users)
     - Bottleneck identification and troubleshooting guide
     - Sample results template

3. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Fixed microcycle test fixture: length_days=14 → 7 (complies with CHECK constraint)
   - Fixed HeuristicConfig references in interference_service:
     - Changed HeuristicConfig.key → HeuristicConfig.name
     - Changed config.value_json → config.json_blob
     - Added HeuristicConfig.active == True to query
   - All interference_service tests now pass (8/8)

**Technical Details**:
- AdaptationService now used in request handling path, not just standalone
- Recovery assessment happens before LLM call, enriching context

---

## Session 7: 2026-01-10 18:00:00 - 22:45:00 UTC

**Objective**: Fix program generation issues, enhance heuristics, and add feedback features

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Fixed Program Generation Flow**:
   - **Dynamic Split Generation**: Implemented `_generate_full_body_structure` to adapt splits dynamically to user's `days_per_week` preference (2-7 days), replacing rigid heuristic configs.
   - **Preference Persistence**: Added `days_per_week` and `disciplines_json` to `Program` model to persist user choices.
   - **LLM Context**: Updated `SessionGenerator` to pass full context (disciplines, movement rules, days/week) to the LLM.
   - **Timeout Adjustment**: Increased Ollama timeout to 1100s (18+ mins) to accommodate complex multi-session generation.

2. **Enhanced Heuristics & Intelligence**:
   - **Interference Logic**: Implemented `daily_muscle_volume` tracking in `ProgramService`.
     - Tracks volume load per muscle across the microcycle.
     - Passes "Fatigued Muscles" list to LLM prompt to prevent back-to-back heavy loading (e.g., heavy Quads on consecutive days).
   - **Movement Variety**: Added `used_movements` tracking within `_generate_session_content` loop.
     - Passes "Recent History" to LLM to enforce variety and avoid repeating exercises within a week.
   - **Supersets & Conditioning**: Updated prompts to explicitly request supersets for accessory work and allow BOTH Accessory and Finisher blocks if time permits.

3. **New Feedback Features**:
   - **Model Updates**: Added `enjoyment_rating` (1-5) and `feedback_tags` (JSON) to `WorkoutLog` model.
   - **API Integration**: Updated `create_workout_log` endpoint and schemas to accept and store user feedback.

4. **Data & Validation Improvements**:
   - **Seeding**: Imported 82 new movements from CSV, enriching database with detailed discipline tags (CrossFit, Powerlifting, etc.) and muscle targets.
   - **Data Normalization**: Standardized `skill_level` to numeric 1-5 scale and enforced minimum skill levels for complex patterns (Olympic lifting).
   - **Enum Updates**: Added `CONDITIONING` and `CARDIO` to `MovementPattern` enum in both backend and frontend to support new movement types.

**Technical Implementation**:
- `ProgramService`: Now maintains state (`daily_muscle_volume`, `used_movements`) during the session generation loop.
- `SessionGenerator`: Accepts dynamic state constraints and injects them into the `build_full_session_prompt`.
- `Migrations`: Applied SQLite migrations for new columns (`enjoyment_rating`, `feedback_tags`, `days_per_week`, `disciplines_json`).

**Status**:
- Program creation creates correct number of days (e.g. 4) with appropriate structure.
- Sessions include Warmup, Main, Cooldown, and Accessory/Finisher.
- Interference rules prevent same-muscle burnout on consecutive days.
- User feedback mechanism is ready for frontend integration.

## Session 8: 2026-01-14 [Current Session]

**Objective**: Consolidate documentation and clean up project structure

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Documentation Consolidation**:
   - Consolidated `MOVEMENT_VARIETY_ENHANCEMENTS.md`, `ShowMeGains Frontend Implementation Plan.md`, and `Complete Program Creation Flow & Display Implementation.md` into existing documentation files
   - Enhanced `NOTES.md` with movement variety system details and frontend implementation strategy
   - Updated `README.md` with comprehensive feature list, frontend tech stack, and testing information
   - Preserved all important technical details while removing redundant files

2. **File Organization Recommendations**:
   - Identified temporary files for deletion: `backend.log`, `backend.pid`
   - Recommended moving `check_program_status.py` to `scripts/` directory
   - Suggested creating `data/` directory for database files to reduce root clutter

**Technical Details**:
- Movement variety system includes pattern interference rules and intelligent replacement
- Frontend uses React 19 + TypeScript + Vite with comprehensive design system
- Program creation flow integrates LLM-powered session generation
- All documentation now consolidated into 4 core files: NOTES.md, README.md, SESSION_LOG.md, WARP.md

---

## Session 9: 2026-01-15

**Objective**: Organize root-level project files into dedicated folders

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Created docs/ directory for secondary documentation**:
   - Moved `NOTES.md` → `docs/NOTES.md`
   - Moved `PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md` → `docs/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md`
   - Moved `WARP.md` → `docs/WARP.md`
2. **Verified references and imports**:
   - Searched the codebase for references to moved files
   - Confirmed they are only referenced from documentation, so no Python or TypeScript import paths required updates
3. **Reduced root directory clutter**:
   - Root now focuses on application code, configuration, environment, and entrypoint files
   - Documentation is logically grouped under `docs/` for easier discovery

4. **Cleaned up legacy SQLite artifacts**:
   - Removed `workout_coach.db`, `workout_coach.db-shm`, and `workout_coach.db-wal` leftover from the previous SQLite setup
   - Confirmed no code paths or processes reference `workout_coach.db*` now that PostgreSQL is the primary database

**Technical Details**:
- `docs/` is now the canonical location for detailed backend/frontend notes and performance guidance
- `README.md` and `SESSION_LOG.md` remain at the project root as primary entrypoint documents

---

## Session 10: 2026-01-16

**Objective**: Enrich movement metadata with primary disciplines and integrate CrossFit circuits

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Movement Schema Enrichment**:
   - Added `primary_discipline` column to the `Movement` model in `app/models/movement.py` with a default of `"All"`.
   - Created and applied Alembic migration `f7b2ea3f26c9_add_primary_discipline_to_movements.py` to update the PostgreSQL schema.

2. **CrossFit Scraping and Ingestion Scripts** (in `scripts/`):
   - `scrape_crossfit_workouts.py`: Scrapes `crossfit.com/workout`, extracts daily workouts, identifies circuit type, parses movements, and writes:
     - `seed_data/scraped_circuits.json` for circuit templates
     - `seed_data/net_new_movements.json` for potential new movements.
   - `ingest_crossfit_circuits.py`: 
     - Ingests net-new CrossFit movements into the `movements` table, tagging them with `primary_discipline="CrossFit"`.
     - Ingests circuit templates into `circuit_templates`, handling empty/duplicate circuits safely.
   - `enrich_movements.py`:
     - Backfills `primary_discipline` for all existing movements:
       - `"CrossFit"` for movements present in `clean_crossfit_movements.json`.
       - `"Bodybuilding"` for movements with pattern `isolation`.
       - `"Olympic Lifting"` for movements with pattern `olympic`.
       - `"Mobility"` for movements with pattern `mobility`.
       - `"All"` for everything else.
   - `verify_disciplines.py`:
     - Verifies distribution of `primary_discipline` across movements and prints sample checks by name for quick sanity validation.

3. **Data Quality Verification**:
   - Confirmed that CrossFit circuits are ingested without duplicate templates and that empty circuits are skipped or replaced.
   - Verified movement discipline counts (e.g., `CrossFit`, `Bodybuilding`, `Mobility`, `Olympic Lifting`, `All`) and spot-checked representative movements to ensure correct classification.

**Status**:
- Movements now carry a first-class `primary_discipline` field, enabling higher-level filtering and UI surfacing.
- CrossFit-specific movements and circuits are integrated into the core database with safe re-runs of ingestion scripts.
- Scripts in `scripts/` folder are documented and can be reused for future data refreshes.

---

## Session 11: 2026-01-18 (Day)

**Objective**: Stabilize backend test suite and design movement relationship architecture

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Stabilized Backend Test Suite**:
   - Resolved 60+ failing unit and integration tests by aligning test fixtures with the latest schema (e.g., `primary_region`, `days_per_week`, and `name` fields).
   - Fixed DeloadService logic to correctly aggregate `sleep_hours` and handle new program start dates, preventing incorrect deload triggers.
   - Corrected AdaptationService queries to load movement patterns via `SessionExercise`, eliminating `NameError` and missing pattern issues.
   - Implemented missing methods in TimeEstimationService for session and microcycle duration estimation.
   - Updated pytest configuration to use async mode for all async tests.

2. **Movement Relationship Architecture Design**:
   - Defined a Postgres-based graph model using a `movement_relationships` table to represent `PROGRESSION`, `REGRESSION`, `ANTAGONIST`, and `EQUIVALENT` edges between movements.
   - Standardized edge direction semantics so `PROGRESSION` edges always point from easier → harder movements, enabling regressions by traversing edges in reverse.
   - Outlined a hybrid reasoning approach combining explicit edges, movement tags (pattern, region, skill level, discipline), and optional embeddings for future “similar movement” recommendations.
   - Documented how session adaptation can use this graph to propose regressions, progressions, antagonistic pairings, and equivalent substitutions while preserving program intent.

**Status**:
- All existing tests pass after schema and logic fixes, providing a reliable foundation for future features.
- Movement relationship architecture is defined and ready for implementation in the backend and future UI tooling.

---

## Session 12: 2026-01-18 (Evening)

**Objective**: Extend schema for long-term goals, integrations, and canonical activities; stabilize migrations on PostgreSQL; and ensure program flows remain intact.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Database Schema Expansion for Roadmap**:
   - Added new models and migrations for long-horizon planning:
     - `macro_cycles`, `goals`, and `goal_checkins` to support 12-month macro cycles and time-bounded goals with check-ins.
     - `user_profiles` and `user_biometrics_history` to track DOB, sex, height, and longitudinal biometrics with data source attribution.
   - Introduced an integrations “data lake”:
     - `external_provider_accounts`, `external_ingestion_runs`, `external_activity_records`, and `external_metric_streams` for ingesting Strava/Garmin/Apple Health/WHOOP/Oura activities and metric streams.
   - Defined a canonical activity model:
     - `disciplines`, `activity_definitions`, and `activity_instances` for normalized activity types and user activity history (planned, manual, and provider-sourced).
   - Added fatigue/anatomy scaffolding:
     - `muscles`, `movement_muscle_map`, `activity_muscle_map`, and `user_fatigue_state` to support future load inference and fatigue tracking.
   - Created `activity_instance_links` to bridge canonical activities with legacy `workout_logs` and external activity records for gradual migration.

2. **Alembic Migration Hardening (PostgreSQL + SQLite)**:
   - Updated all new migrations to be idempotent against existing Postgres databases:
     - Guarded enum creation using `pg_type` checks (`sex`, `datasource`, `biometricmetrictype`, `goaltype`, `goalstatus`, `externalprovider`, `ingestionrunstatus`, `disciplinecategory`, `activitycategory`, `activitysource`, `metrictype`, `musclerole`).
     - Guarded table and column creation via `sa.inspect(conn).has_table(...)` and column introspection so rerunning migrations on drifted databases does not fail.
   - Fixed visibility enum handling:
     - Ensured `visibility` enum is created once (in `6180f4706b14_add_visibility_and_template_flags.py`) and reused in later migrations (e.g., `cd3456ef7890_add_activity_definitions_and_instances.py`) without duplicate type creation.
   - Made SQLite-compatible changes:
     - Wrapped column/index/FK changes in `op.batch_alter_table(...)` for SQLite (e.g., `movements.user_id`, `sessions.main_circuit_id`/`finisher_circuit_id`, `programs.macro_cycle_id`) so the migrations run cleanly in the in-memory test DB.
   - Added an Alembic migrations smoke test:
     - `tests/test_migrations_smoke.py` runs upgrade/downgrade on a disposable SQLite DB by default.
     - Added optional Postgres smoke test gated by `MIGRATIONS_SMOKE_DATABASE_URL` to validate migrations on a real PostgreSQL instance in CI.

3. **Program Flow Verification and Bug Fixes**:
   - Diagnosed “Network error while creating a program” and “no programs visible” regressions:
     - Root cause: local Postgres schema was behind the ORM/migrations (missing new enums/tables/columns), causing 500s when listing or creating programs.
   - Brought local Postgres schema to head:
     - Fixed failing migrations (duplicate enum/table errors) and successfully ran `alembic upgrade head` to align the DB with the latest schema.
   - Verified program flows against production-like Postgres:
     - Wrote a small reproduction script (later removed) that:
       - Listed programs for an existing user.
       - Created a new program using `ProgramService.create_program`, ensuring microcycles and sessions are generated correctly.
     - Confirmed program listing and creation now succeed without backend errors, and the frontend no longer shows empty-program or network-error states.

4. **Documentation and Data Dictionary Update**:
   - Updated `# Gainsly Database System Overview.md` to reflect:
     - Enum storage semantics (Python Enum vs. Postgres native enum vs. SQLite fallback).
     - New tables for goals, biometrics, integrations, canonical activities, and fatigue state.
     - Clarified ambiguities around session JSON vs. normalized `session_exercises` and the current source-of-truth.

5. **Test Suite Health**:
   - Ran `pytest -q` to validate that:
     - All existing unit and integration tests still pass after schema changes.
     - The new migrations smoke test passes on SQLite, and the optional Postgres smoke test passes when pointed at a disposable Postgres instance.

**Status**:
- PostgreSQL schema is now fully aligned with the ORM models and resilient to reruns on drifted databases.
- Roadmap-critical tables (goals, biometrics, integrations, canonical activities, fatigue) are scaffolded with migrations and models.
- Program list and creation flows are stable again on the real Postgres backend.
- Migrations are exercised both on SQLite (fast CI guardrail) and optionally on PostgreSQL (production-like validation).

---

## Session 13: 2026-01-19

**Objective**: Wire advanced user preferences into program/session generation and stabilize frontend flows

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Advanced Profile Preferences**:
   - Extended `UserProfile` model and settings API to store discipline priorities (mobility, calisthenics, Olympic lifts, CrossFit-style lifts, cardio) and scheduling preferences (mix vs dedicated days, cardio as finisher vs dedicated day).
   - Updated Settings Profile UI to include an “Advanced Filters” collapsible section where users configure these preferences and save them reliably.

2. **Program Builder Integration**:
   - Updated `ProgramService` to read `UserProfile` preferences and feed them into split generation, dynamically converting rest days into dedicated mobility/cardio days when the user prefers dedicated discipline days.
   - Ensured new `disciplines_json` and days-per-week settings are passed through to the LLM as part of the program context.

3. **Session Generation Improvements**:
   - Updated `SessionGeneratorService` and session prompts to include discipline and scheduling preferences so Jerome can adjust warmups, mains, accessories, and finishers (including 10–20 minute cardio finishers) in line with user goals.
   - Added robust fallback logic for LLM failures using movement-library-driven templates and intelligent duplicate removal/replacement to keep sessions trainable even when the LLM is unavailable or returns bad JSON.

4. **Bug Fixes and Stability**:
   - Fixed `NameError` and import issues around `UserProfile` in both `ProgramService` and `SessionGeneratorService` that previously caused “Network error while creating program” and “Generation Error” states in the UI.
   - Hardened background session generation so failed sessions are marked with clear “Generation failed” notes and placeholder content instead of hanging spinners, making failures visible but non-blocking.
   - Resolved frontend regressions in the Settings and Program creation flows so white-screen and missing-spinner issues no longer occur when advanced preferences are enabled.

**Status**:
- Program creation now respects stored advanced profile preferences end-to-end.
- Session generation is more resilient, with structured fallbacks and clearer error surfaces.
- Frontend flows (Settings, Create Program, Program detail) are stable again with the new preferences wired in.

## Session 14: 2026-01-19 (Refactor Settings & Goals)

**Objective**: Refactor Settings page, fix critical bugs, and enhance user profile data model

**Key Accomplishments**:

1. **Settings Page Refactor**:

## Session 15: 2026-01-20

**Objective**: Resolve app-wide loading failures, fix program creation errors, and optimize session generation.

**Key Accomplishments**:

1.  **Resolved Database & Async Blocking Issues**:
    *   Increased database connection pool size (20) and max overflow (20) in `app/db/database.py` to prevent pool exhaustion.
    *   Offloaded synchronous OR-Tools solver calls to separate threads using `asyncio.run_in_executor` in `app/services/session_generator.py` to fix app-wide event loop blocking.
    *   Converted `SolverMovement` objects to Pydantic DTOs for thread safety.

2.  **Fixed Program Creation & Session Generation**:
    *   Added `used_main_patterns` parameter to `populate_session_by_id` in `app/services/session_generator.py` to fix keyword argument errors.
    *   Implemented `split_template` inference in `app/services/program.py` to handle missing frontend payload data and prevent database integrity errors.
    *   Added 10-second timeout to OR-Tools solver in `app/llm/optimization.py` to prevent infinite loops.
    *   Fixed `ProgramCreate` schema validation aliases in `app/schemas/program.py` to correctly map database JSON columns (`warmup_json`, `main_json`, etc.) to frontend fields.

3.  **Configuration & Testing**:
    *   Updated default LLM model to `llama3.2:3b` (faster, JSON-optimized) in `app/config/settings.py`.
    *   Created `repro_create_program_v2.py` and `debug_session_generation.py` for targeted diagnostics.

**Status**:
- App responsiveness restored.
- Program creation flow unblocked (no more "Network error").
- Frontend session card expansion issue resolved (schema mapping fixed).
- LLM timeout risk reduced with optimized model selection.

**Key Decisions & Updates**:
*   **Model Optimization**: Switched to `llama3.2:3b` to resolve timeout issues and improve inference speed (settings.py).
*   **Documentation**: Fully updated `Gainsly Database System Overview.md` with all new tables and enums.
*   **Git**: Renamed branch to `Iteration/new-DB-structure-and-ensemble-model-generation-wfl` for ongoing development.


## Session 16 : 2026-01-20 23:47
*** What’s happening now (diagnosis)***
   - Goals/weights are saved correctly (see [ProgramCreate schema](file:///Users/shourjosmac/Documents/Gainsly/app/schemas/program.py#L75-L124) and persistence in [program.py](file:///Users/shourjosmac/Documents/Gainsly/app/services/program.py)).
   - Missing finisher occurs when draft generation fails and we fall back to content builders that always return `finisher=None` ([_get_smart_fallback_session_content](file:///Users/shourjosmac/Documents/Gainsly/app/services/session_generator.py#L1329-L1435)).
   - Draft generation is currently likely failing due to concrete bugs:
      - invalid `SessionType.CONDITIONING` reference (SessionType lacks CONDITIONING: [enums.py](file:///Users/shourjosmac/Documents/Gainsly/app/models/enums.py#L141-L153))
      - optimizer duration bug in [optimization.py](file:///Users/shourjosmac/Documents/Gainsly/app/services/optimization.py)

** Updated requirements (your edits)**
- Warmup always.
- Middle piece is either:
  - Main lifts + (Accessory XOR Finisher), OR
  - Cardio-only block, OR
  - Conditioning-only block.
- Cooldown always.
- Cardio-only and conditioning-only days must NOT have accessory/finisher.
- Conditioning definition: ≥5 conditioning movements (e.g., sled push/pull, battle ropes) for ≥30 minutes.
- Cardio/conditioning-only day introduced only when:
  1) overtraining risk, OR
  2) beginner safety steering, OR
  3) advanced profile filters allow it.

**Plan** 

 1) Fix regression so goal-based finishers return
   - Replace invalid enum usage and represent conditioning-only sessions using `SessionType.CUSTOM` + intent tag `"conditioning"` (no DB enum migration required).
   - Fix optimizer duration calculation so draft generation succeeds.
   - Add universal postprocessing so goal-driven finisher injection happens even on fallback paths.

2) Enforce the session-structure rules globally
   -  Implement one normalizer function that enforces:
      - Warmup + cooldown always.
      - If cardio-only or conditioning-only session: only that middle piece.
      - Else: main + (accessory XOR finisher), never both.
   - Run this normalizer on all generation paths (draft, LLM, fallback).

3) Implement conditioning middle-piece generator
   - Define conditioning candidates via Movement fields:
       - `Movement.pattern == "conditioning"` and/or `"conditioning" in Movement.tags`.
   - Build a conditioning block with ≥5 movements totaling ≥30 minutes (duration-driven prescriptions).

4) Add goal-based weekly time distribution (config-driven)
- Create `app/config/activity_distribution.py` with:
      - caps: `mobility_max_pct = 0.30`, `cardio_max_pct = 0.75`, etc.
      - `preference_deviation_pct = 0.15`
      - allocation parameters (how to convert goal weights → weekly minutes → number of dedicated sessions vs finisher minutes)
      - **BIAS TEXT** (your requested transparency): a `BIAS_RATIONALE` structure containing human-readable strings explaining the system’s intended mapping, e.g.
         - fat_loss biases toward metabolic finishers and/or dedicated cardio-only days
         - endurance biases toward dedicated cardio blocks or interval finishers
         - strength/hypertrophy biases toward main+accessory volume
         - mobility biases toward mobility-only sessions and extended warmup/cooldown
  - **BIAS LINKS**: a `HARD_CODED_BIAS_LOCATIONS` list of file/function paths where bias is currently hardcoded today, so it’s auditable.
   - Modify ProgramService weekly structure builder to:
      - compute total weekly minutes
      - allocate bucket minutes proportional to goal weights, clamp to caps
      - decide cardio-only/conditioning-only days *only* when allowed by the 3 rules
      - otherwise allocate cardio/conditioning minutes into lifting-day finishers

5) Make session optimization goal-aware + bounded user preference margin
   - Update the solver objective to maximize a weighted goal score rather than stimulus-only.
   - Apply user favorites/preferred movements as an additive term bounded by `preference_deviation_pct` from the config.

6) Remove hardcoded finisher thresholds and make them configurable
   - Replace current hardcoded checks like `fat_loss >= 5` in [_build_goal_finisher](file:///Users/shourjosmac/Documents/Gainsly/app/services/session_generator.py#L800-L823) with config-driven thresholds/weights in `app/config/activity_distribution.py`.
   - Ensure any remaining implicit thresholds (durations, minimum finisher minutes, etc.) are represented as named variables in that config module.

7) Jerome’s Notes ≤200 characters
   - Enforce a hard 200-character max on `coach_notes` (prompt + post-trim).

8) Verification
   - Add regression tests:
      - fat_loss=6 yields finisher on lifting days even when draft fails.
      - lifting days never contain both accessory and finisher.
      - cardio-only/conditioning-only days contain only the correct middle piece.
      - weekly planner respects caps and introduces cardio/conditioning days only under your 3 rules.

**Key transparency deliverable (your request)**
- The new config module will contain both:
  - variables controlling behavior (caps, thresholds, preference margin), and
  - plain-text bias rationale + explicit paths to any remaining hardcoded bias.
