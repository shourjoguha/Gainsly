Reduce the reps of each movement.\n\n\nTo reduce the complexity of the goblet squats, decrease the range of motion by squatting to a target.\n\n\nIn case of injury or limitation, for the Russian kettlebell swings, perform kettlebell deadlifts or single-arm Russian kettlebell swings. For the goblet squats, perform goblet lunges or air squats. For the Turkish get-ups, perform kettlebell windmills.\n\n\nIntermediate option:\n\nFor time:\n\n30 Russian kettlebell swings\n\n30 kettlebell goblet squats\n\n5 kettlebell Turkish get-ups, right arm\n\n5 kettlebell Turkish get-ups, left arm\n\n20 Russian kettlebell swings\n\n20 kettlebell goblet squats\n\n4 kettlebell Turkish get-ups, right arm\n\n4 kettlebell Turkish get-ups, left arm\n\n10 Russian kettlebell swings\n\n10 kettlebell goblet squats\n\n3 kettlebell Turkish get-ups, right arm\n\n3 kettlebell Turkish get-ups, left arm\n\n\n\u2640 \n35-lb kettlebell for the swings and 26-lb kettlebell for the Turkish get-up\n\n\u2642 \n53-lb kettlebell for the swings and 35-lb kettlebell for the Turkish get-up\n\n\nBeginner option:\n\nFor time:\n\n\n20\n Russian kettlebell swings\n\n\n20\n kettlebell goblet squats\n\n\n4\n kettlebell Turkish get-ups, right arm\n\n\n4\n kettlebell Turkish get-ups, left arm\n\n\n15\n Russian kettlebell swings\n\n\n15\n kettlebell goblet squats\n\n\n3\n kettlebell Turkish get-ups, right arm\n\n\n3\n kettlebell Turkish get-ups, left arm\n\n10 Russian kettlebell swings\n\n10 kettlebell goblet squats\n\n\n2\n kettlebell Turkish get-ups, right arm\n\n\n2\n kettlebell Turkish get-ups, left arm\n\n\n\u2640 \n18-lb kettlebell for the swings and 10-lb dumbbell for the Turkish get-up\n\n\u2642 \n26-lb kettlebell for the swings and 15-lb dumbbell for the Turkish get-up\n\n\nCoaching cues:\n\nFor the kettlebell Turkish get-ups, take your time.

Reduce the reps of each movement.\n\n\nTo reduce the complexity of the squat cleans, perform a hang squat clean. For the box jumps, reduce the height of the box. For the overhead walking lunges, perform walking lunges with a single dumbbell in the goblet position.\n\n\nIn case of injury or limitation, for the run, perform 3,200/4,000 meters on the rower or ski erg or 7,000/10,000 meters on the Echo bike. For the squat cleans, perform power cleans, plus a front squat, or power cleans if there is a squatting limitation. For the box jumps, perform box step-ups. For the overhead walking lunges, perform walking lunges with no weight.\n\n\nIntermediate option:\n\nFor time:\n\nRun 2 miles\n\n\nRest 2 minutes\n\n\n20 squat cleans\n\n20 box jumps\n\n20 overhead walking lunges with a plate\n\n20 box jumps\n\n20 squat cleans\n\n\nRest 2 minutes\n\n\nRun 2 miles\n\n\n\u2640 \n65\n-lb barbell, 20-inch box, \n15\n-lb plate\n\n\u2642 \n95\n-lb barbell, 24-inch box, \n25\n-lb plate\n\n\nBeginner option:\n\nFor time:\n\n\n800-meter\n run\n\n\nRest 2 minutes\n\n\n15 hang\n squat cleans\n\n\n15\n box \nstep-ups\n\n20 \nwalking lunge steps\n\n\n15\n box \nstep-ups\n\n\n15 hang\n squat cleans\n\n\nRest 2 minutes\n\n\n800-meter\n run\n\n\n\u2640 \n35\n-lb barbell and a \n12\n-inch box\n\n\u2642 \n45\n-lb barbell and a \n20\n-inch box\n\n\nCoaching cues:\n\nDuring the overhead walking lunges, press the plate into the sky.

If you've been doing push-ups, planks, or overhead movements without understanding active shoulders, you're probably doing them wrong and missing out on both safety and performance gains. This one concept applies to nearly every upper-body movement you do in CrossFit, and understanding it changes everything.\n\n\nFind a gym near you:\n\n\nView the CrossFit map\nWednesday 251231\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWednesday 251231\n\n\n\n\nHidalgo\n\n\nFor time:\n\nRun 2 miles\n\n\nRest 2 minutes\n\n\n20 squat cleans\n\n20 box jumps\n\n20 overhead walking lunges with a plate\n\n20 box jumps\n\n20 squat cleans\n\n\nRest 2 minutes\n\n\nRun 2 miles\n\n\nIf you've got a 20-lb  vest or body armor, wear it.\n\n\n\u2640 95-lb barbell, 20-inch box, 25-lb plate\n\n\u2642 135-lb barbell, 24-inch box, 45-lb plate\n\n\nCompare to \n111229\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Army First Lieutenant Daren M.

    "description": ":\n\nToday\u2019s workout is a combination of strength, stamina, and cardiorespiratory endurance. Keep in mind that this workout is not only for time, but also for total reps of double-unders and burpees. The loading of the barbell should be heavy, but allow you to complete the set of 21 in 4 sets or less, while maintaining proper form. If you are struggling to maintain a neutral spine, reduce the loading. Expect your heart rate to be significantly elevated after the double-unders and burpees. Take a few breaths to get yourself set before picking up the heavy barbell.\n\n\nScaling:\n\nReduce the loading of the barbell.\n\n\nTo reduce the complexity of the double-unders, perform single-unders. For the burpees, perform up-downs.\n\n\nIn case of injury or limitation, perform sumo deadlifts with the barbell or a kettlebell.

    "description": ":\n\nToday\u2019s workout is all bodyweight movements. Scale the difficulty of each element so you can keep moving and perform the reps of each movement unbroken \u2014 more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.\n\n\nScaling:\n\nThe exercises with the most reps are push-ups through jumping lunges \u2014 anywhere from 36 to 42 reps. Reduce the reps as needed or only perform the even rounds (i.e., in Round 1, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 2, complete 4 knee push-ups, 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding two new exercises each even round).\n\n\nTo reduce the complexity of these bodyweight movements, reduce the range of motion. For example, on the wall walks, only take two steps toward the wall or perform inchworms. On the burpees, perform up-downs. On the handstand push-ups, perform dumbbell shoulder presses or pike push-ups. And for the single-leg squats, use a higher target, air squats, or even a narrow-stance air squat.\n\n\nIn case of injury or limitation, substitute equipment to preserve the movement function as much as possible, or choose an alternative suitable for your situation.\n\n\nIntermediate option:\n\nSame as Rx\u2019d.\n\n\nBeginner option:\n\n12 rounds for time, starting with 1 and adding an exercise each round:\n\n1 \ninchworm\n\n2 candlestick rocks\n\n3 burpees\n\n4 push-ups \nfrom the knees\n\n5 walking lunges\n\n6 air squats\n\n7 sit-ups\n\n8 jumping squats\n\n9 jumping lunges\n\n10 broad jumps\n\n11 \ndumbbell shoulder presses\n\n12 \nbox step-ups\n\n\n\u2640 \n10-lb dumbbell, 12-inch box\n\n\u2642 \n15-lb dumbbell, 20-inch box\n\n\nPerform the workout like the \"12 Days of Christmas\" song.

This simple piece of foam does something that nothing else replicates: it lets your abs work through their full range of motion, eliminating the weak range many people ignore.

    "description": ":\n\nToday\u2019s workout is all bodyweight movements. Scale the difficulty of each element so you can keep moving and perform the reps of each movement unbroken \u2014 more moving and less hook-gripping your shorts.\n\n\nScaling:\n\nThe exercises with the most reps are push-ups through jumping lunges \u2014 anywhere from 36 to 42 reps. Reduce the reps as needed or only perform the even rounds (i.e., in Round 1, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 2, complete 4 knee push-ups, 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding two new exercises each even round).\n\n\nTo reduce the complexity of these bodyweight movements, reduce the range of motion. For example, on the wall walks, only take two steps toward the wall or perform inchworms. On the burpees, perform up-downs. On the handstand push-ups, perform dumbbell shoulder presses or pike push-ups. And for the single-leg squats, use a higher target, air squats, or even a narrow-stance air squat.\n\n\nIn case of injury or limitation, substitute equipment to preserve the movement function as much as possible, or choose an alternative suitable for your situation.\n\n\nIntermediate option:\n\nSame as Rx\u2019d.\n\n\nBeginner option:\n\n12 rounds for time, starting with 1 and adding an exercise each round:\n\n1 \ninchworm\n\n2 candlestick rocks\n\n3 burpees\n\n4 push-ups \nfrom the knees\n\n5 walking lunges\n\n6 air squats\n\n7 sit-ups\n\n8 jumping squats\n\n9 jumping lunges\n\n10 broad jumps\n\n11 \ndumbbell shoulder presses\n\n12 \nbox step-ups\n\n\n\u2640 \n10-lb dumbbell, 12-inch box\n\n\u2642 \n15-lb dumbbell, 20-inch box\n\n\nPerform the workout like the \"12 Days of Christmas\" song. In Round 1, perform 1 inchworm. In Round 2, perform 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. In Round 3, perform 3 burpees, 2 candlesticks, then 1 inchworm. Continue adding a new exercise each round.\n\n\nCoaching cues:\n\nAs you lower yourself to the bottom of an air squat, think about grabbing the floor with your toes and \u201cscrewing\u201d your feet into the ground. This will keep your knees tracking your toes and your entire foot in contact with the ground.\n\n\nResources:\n\n\nThe Wall Walk\n\n\nCandlestick Conditioning Drills\n\n\nThe Burpee\n\n\nThe Push-Up\n\n\nThe Walking Lunge\n\n\nThe Air Squat\n\n\nThe AbMat Sit-Up\n\n\nThe Jumping Squat\n\n\nJumping Lunge Tips\n\n\nThe Broad Jump\n\n\nThe Kipping Handstand Push-Up\n\n\nThe Single-Leg Squat\n\n\nPush-Up From the Knees\n\n\nThe Dumbbell Press\n\n\nThe Box Step-Up\n\n\nFind a gym near you:\n\n\nView the CrossFit map",
