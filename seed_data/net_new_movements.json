  "When experts recommend replacing back squats with single leg movements to avoid pain, they're treating the symptom, not the cause. Back squats are an essential functional movement that builds capacity across all aspects of fitness. When they cause pain, the solution isn't to abandon them but to scale the load, fix your technique, and address gaps in your overall program. For lifelong health and fitness, the answer is simple: squat more, more often.",
  "Without an AbMat, your abs stop working dynamically about a third of the way through a sit up and become stabilizers while your hip flexors take over. This simple piece of foam does something that nothing else replicates: it lets your abs work through their full range of motion, eliminating the weak range many people ignore. Your AbMat gives you a training stimulus that complements everything else you do in the gym and in life.",
  "You said you'd do of jump rope and quit at 5, which means you just rediscovered what boxers and wrestlers never forgot: this simple tool will humble you and get you in serious shape. While most of our work with the jump rope shows up as double unders in a workout, the single under is a seriously legitimate conditioning implement that builds cardiovascular capacity, develops lower leg resilience, and strengthens footwork and coordination with minimal impact. The irony: if you want better double unders,",

  "Your shoulder isn't actually a ball and socket joint; it's more like a golf ball on a tee, which means it needs to be actively locked in when supporting load. If you've been doing push ups, planks, or overhead movements without understanding active shoulders, you're probably doing them wrong and missing out on both safety and performance gains. This one concept applies to nearly every upper body movement you do in CrossFit, and understanding it changes everything.",
